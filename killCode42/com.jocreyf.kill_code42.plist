<!--
    On a Mac, copy this file to:
        ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

    Lint the file and make sure it's good:
        /> plutil -lint ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jocreyf.kill_code42.plist
            com.jocreyf.kill_code42.plist: OK

    See if we already have a launchd entry for this app:
        /> launchctl list | grep kill_code42

    Load the config in launchd when ready to have the app run in the background:
    (also unload and reload again when changes are made to the config!)
        /> launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jocreyf.kill_code42.plist
        /> launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jocreyf.kill_code42.plist

    Start the app in a background process (or stop it):
    (app output is sent to '/var/log/system.log'.  Just grep for 'kill_code42')
        /> launchctl start com.jocreyf.kill_code42
        /> launchctl stop com.jocreyf.kill_code42
        /> launchctl restart cm.jocreyf.kill_code42

    Install the "launchcontrol" gui tool if you want something better to debug launchd problems:
        /> brew install launchcontrol
